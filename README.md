VMG Chosen Member
========
Fieldtype for Expression Engine 2
--------

**VMG Chosen Member** is a fieldtype for allowing the selection of one or more members inside an entry. It's specifically designed for use on sites with a large amount of members, in cases where a regular `<select>` dropdown with thousands of `<option>`s would decrease publish page performance.

It includes autocomplete capabilities and the friendly selection/listing of large numbers of members using a modified version of the [Chosen](http://harvesthq.github.com/chosen/) JavaScript plugin. VMG Chosen Member also offers various methods of using the selected members within your templates.

**VMG Chosen Member** can be used alone, within [Matrix](http://pixelandtonic.com/matrix/), [Low Variables](http://gotolow.com/addons/low-variables/), and [Better Workflow](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/better-workflow/).

Usage
-------

### Single Variable Tag

	{custom_field}
> Outputs the pipe (|) delimited list of member IDs.

> #### Parameters
*	**member_id** = "1|2|3"<br />Limit returned members to those specified.
*	**group_id** = "1|2|3"<br />While you can limit selections to specific member groups in the field's settings, this parameter allows you to further limit results on output.
*	**orderby** = "email"<br />The *orderby* parameter sets the display order of the output.
*	**sort** = "asc"<br />The *sort* order will be applied if you specify an *orderby* parameter.
*	**limit** = "1"<br />The *limit* parameter will set the number of results that will be returned.
*	**backspace** = "0"<br />Remove _X_ number of characters from the final tag output.

### Variable Tag Pair

	{custom_field}
		<h2>{cm_screen_name}</h2>
		<p>Email: {cm_email}</p>
		<p>Some custom member field: {cm_some_custom_member_field}</p>
	{/custom_field}
> Outputs member data for the selected members and provides access to all data tags.<br />**Note:** A prefix of "cm_" is added by default, but can be manually changed or set to empty if desired.

> #### Parameters
*	All parameters from the [Single Tag Pair](#single-variable-tag) plus:
*	**prefix** = "cm\_"<br/>**Set to "cm\_" by default**<br />By providing a prefix, all data tags will be parsed prepended with the string of your choosing. This can be helpful for avoiding naming collisions.
*	**backspace** = "0"<br />Remove _X_ number of characters from the final tag output.
*	**disable** = "member_data"<br />Setting this to *member_data* will bypass the loading of custom member fields.


### :total_members Tag

	{chosen_member_field:total_members}
> Outputs the total number of members selected within the field.


### Associated Entries

To view Channel Entries that a member has been selected in (via a VMG Chosen Member field), you can use the {exp:vmg_chosen_member:assoc_entries} tag.

**NOTE:** As of v2.0, this tag mimics the functionality of a Channel Entries loop. To disable this, and simply return a pipe-delimited list of entry IDs, set *display_entries="no"*.

	{!-- Standard usage --}
	{exp:vmg_chosen_member:assoc_entries
		field="chosen_member_field"
		member_id="1|2|3"
	}

		<ul>
			{chosen_member_field prefix="cmf_"}

				<li>
					<h3>{cmf_screen_name}</h3>
					<img src="/path/to/avatars/{cmf_avatar_filename}"/>
				</li>

			{/chosen_member_field}
		</ul>

	{/exp:vmg_chosen_member:assoc_entries}

	{!-- Example of using display_entries="no" --}
	{exp:vmg_chosen_member:assoc_entries
		field="chosen_member_field"
		member_id="1|2|3"
		prefix="cm_"
		display_entries="no"
	}

		Pipe-delimited list of related entry IDs: {cm_entry_ids}

	{/exp:vmg_chosen_member:assoc_entries}

> #### Parameters
*	{exp:vmg\_chosen\_member:assoc\_entries} can take nearly all of [{exp:channel:entries}â€™ tag parameters](http://ellislab.com/expressionengine/user-guide/modules/channel/channel_entries.html#parameters), as well as the following:
*	**field** = "chosen_member_field"<br />The VMG Chosen Member field you would like to search. If your VMG Chosen Member field is within a Matrix field, you would set the name of the parent Matrix field.
*	**col** = "my_matrix_col"<br />If your VMG Chosen Member field is within a Matrix field, you would set the name of the Matrix column here.
*	**member\_id** = "1|2|3"<br />Member IDs that you would like to search for.
*	**display_entries** = "yes"<br/>**Set to "yes" by default**<br />If "yes", this tag will mimic a Channel Entries loop. Otherwise, it returns a variable called {entry_ids} containing a pipe delimited list of all relevant entry IDs.
*	**prefix** = "cm\_"<br/>**Set to "cm\_" by default**<br />If **display_entries** = "no", the {entry_ids} single variable will be parsed prepended with the string of your choosing. This can be helpful for avoiding naming collisions.

> Returns all relevant entries. If **display\_entries** = "no", outputs the prefixed {entry_ids} tag.

VMG Chosen Member can be used within [Matrix](http://pixelandtonic.com/matrix/), [Low Variables](http://gotolow.com/addons/low-variables/), and [Better Workflow](http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/better-workflow/).
